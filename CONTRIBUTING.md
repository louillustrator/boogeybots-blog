# Contributing Guide

## How to get started

- Fork the repo
- Add yourself to contribs.yaml as:
```yaml
-   # <- Note the dash and the indentation!
    name_or_pseudonym: github_profile
```
- Find an [Issue](https://github.com/BoogeyBots/boogeybots-blog/issues) to work on or start to implement some changes that YOU would like to see on our website.
- After you have done the changes, send a Pull Request and we'll look into it

# PR Requirements (or guidelines or something)
- We must like what you did. If you murder our website, we kill your PR.
- Don't add useless node packages.
- If you're code solves a problem we have you're pretty much merged
- I don't even know my indent styles at this point so pretty much anything is ok as long as it's not reaaaaaly crazy (like 8-space tabs, they give me the *c h i l l s*)
