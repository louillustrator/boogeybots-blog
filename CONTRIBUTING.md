# Contributing Guide

## How to get started

- Fork the repo
- Create a new branch from the `develop` branch and give it a name related to what you're doing. (ex: `home-style` for something that *mainly* changes the style of the homepage)
- Install node packages: `npm install`
- Add yourself to contribs.yaml as follows:
```yaml
-   # <- Note the dash and the indentation!
    name_or_pseudonym: github_profile
```
- Work on an [Issue](https://github.com/BoogeyBots/boogeybots-blog/issues) or start to implement some changes that YOU would like to see on our website.
- After you have done the changes, send a Pull Request to `develop` and we'll look into it.

# PR Requirements (or guidelines or something)
- We must like what you did. If you murder our website, we kill your PR.
- Don't add useless node packages.
- If you're code solves a problem we have you're pretty much merged
- I don't even know my indent styles at this point so pretty much anything is ok as long as it's not reaaaaaly crazy (like 8-space tabs, they give me the *c h i l l s*)

# Notes 
- You can start the server with `npm start` to breathe life into the files.
